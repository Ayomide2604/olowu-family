								<h3>‚ú® How It All Began (2017‚Äì2018)</h3>
								<div className="timeline-content">
									<p>
										In 2017, at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos,
										fate began writing our love story. It wasn't anything
										dramatic‚Äîjust a few glances, a curious mind, and a shirtless
										guy cooking behind his room every time I passed by on my way
										to church.
									</p>
									<p>
										My curiosity finally got the best of me. The first time I
										saw him in class, I walked straight up to him and said:
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										"You're the one always distracting me when I'm going to
										church. What's your name?"
									</blockquote>
									<p>
										That bold move was the beginning of everything. By February
										2018, we started dating, and we've been growing stronger
										ever since.

								<h3>üå± Growing Together</h3>
								<div className="timeline-content">
									<p>
										Our relationship wasn't instant fireworks‚Äîit was a slow
										burn, a steady deepening. We didn't fall in love overnight.
										But with each shared moment, each conversation, each
										challenge‚Äîwe found something real.
									</p>
									<p>
										We've overcome so much together: financial struggles, school
										stress, personal ups and downs. But we always found strength
										in each other, believing that no matter how difficult it
										gets, we'll get through it‚Äîtogether.

								<h3>üíç The Proposal</h3>
								<div className="timeline-content">
									<p>
										We didn't start with a proposal. We just knew. Knew that we
										wanted this‚Äîus‚Äîforever. But when the moment did come, it was
										intimate, heartfelt, and absolutely perfect for us. No big
										gestures. Just love.

								<h3>‚ù§ Why Us</h3>
								<div className="timeline-content">
									<p>
										What makes our love special is simple: we overcome together.
										Life can throw storms our way, but hand in hand, we always
										find the calm. We believe in each other. We choose each
										other. Every single day.
